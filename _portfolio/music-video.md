## Creative Vision

This music video combines hand-drawn animation with digital effects to create a dreamlike visual experience that complements the artist's ethereal sound. The narrative follows an abstract journey through surreal landscapes that metaphorically represent the song's themes of transformation and self-discovery.

## Animation Workflow

The entire video was created using a combination of traditional frame-by-frame animation and modern digital compositing techniques. Over 2,400 individual frames were hand-drawn and then enhanced digitally.

## Collaboration

Worked closely with the artist to ensure the visual narrative aligned with their creative vision while adding unique interpretive elements that enhanced the overall experience.
