## About the Project

Created a series of whimsical character illustrations for a children's book about friendship and adventure. The project required developing consistent character designs that would appeal to children aged 5-8 while maintaining visual storytelling throughout the narrative.

## Design Philosophy

The illustration style combines soft, organic shapes with vibrant colors to create a welcoming and imaginative world. Each character was designed with distinct personality traits reflected in their visual appearance.

## Character Development

The project involved creating:
- 8 main character designs
- Multiple expression sheets
- Environmental illustrations
- Cover artwork

Every illustration was carefully crafted to support the story's emotional beats and help young readers connect with the characters.
